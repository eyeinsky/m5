# Command line/output configuration

* add a 'stream name equals filename' flag

   Behavior is simple: all stream names are at filenames too,
   and no output mappings need to be defined on the commandline.

* Generate warning when baseDir is something, but no file outputs
  have been defined.

* figure out an elaborate testing scheme, so I wouldn't f... up

* try to use common command line conventions, e.g
  http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch10s05.html for command line
  and others. See also the flag reference of m4.
